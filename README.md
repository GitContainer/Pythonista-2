### Hello it's nice to have you here!
> This is a repository that includes works since the beginning of my college career until now.
> I try to keep this repository updated as much as possible so that you can see what I have been working on!
> Although, there have been other courses I took since 2015 that are not included in this repository.
> Some of the code are self explanatory and some have comments that will guide you through. Have fun!
