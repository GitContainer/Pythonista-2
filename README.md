| 1 | Beautiful is better than ugly. | :snake: |                                       
| 2 | Explicit is better than implicit. | :snake: |
| 3 | Simple is better than complex. | :snake: |
| 4 | Complex is better than complicated. | :snake: |
| 5 | Flat is better than nested. | :snake: |
| 6 | Sparse is better than dense. | :snake: |
| 7 | Readability counts. | :snake: |
| 8 | Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. | :snake: |
| 9 | Although practicality beats purity. | :snake: |
|10 | Errors should never pass silently. | :snake: |
|11 | Unless explicitly silenced. | :snake: |
|12 | In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. | :snake: |
|13 | There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. | :snake: |
|14 | Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. | :snake: |
|15 | Now is better than never. | :snake: |
|16 | Although never is often better than *right* now. | :snake: |
|17 | If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. | :snake: |
|18 | If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. | :snake: |
|19 | Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! | :snake: |
