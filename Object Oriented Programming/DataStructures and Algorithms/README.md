# Data Structures and Algorithms

* This repository includes my own implementation of Basic Data Structures: Stack, Queues, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Trees etc..
and well known Algorithms such as Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Djikstra's Algorithm etc..

* I am currently on the journey of learning more advanced algorithms and will keep updating this repo :thumbsup:
